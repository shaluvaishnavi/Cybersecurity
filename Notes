.bat file(Batch file)

*   @echo off            *
To start an application by using these commands.

XAMPP Server =>OOPS (IT CONTAINS UI)

Same IP ADDRESS AND SAME SUBNET IS CALLED AS LAN(LOCAL AREA NETWORK)

To see all commands using command --help
ping --help

For windows we use -n
For Linux we use -c

use 2 option ------ it has un allocated space 
then create new and apply to allocate space ---- dispartition space should be deleted
give 60 gb allocation and apply if the primary allocated will installed
