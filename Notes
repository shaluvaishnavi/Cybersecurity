DAY 2..............................................................

Windows can run these two files
.exe file(Executable file)
.bat file(Batch file)

*   @echo off            *
To start an application by using these commands.

XAMPP Server =>OOPS (IT CONTAINS UI)

Same IP ADDRESS AND SAME SUBNET IS CALLED AS LAN(LOCAL AREA NETWORK)

To see all commands using command --help
ping --help

For windows we use -n
For Linux we use -c
CISCO PACKET TRACER
Same networks devices to connect => cross over
Different types of network devices=> Straight through
To connect two routers =>coaxial.
NETWORK DEVICES:

HALF DUPLEX:ONLY ONE SIDED CONNECTION(WAKI TAKI)
FULL DUPLEX:MULTI TASKING.
MAC ADDRESS=> Permanent address for network devices.

PING USERS=> PROTOCOL=>ICMP(INTERNET CONTROL MESSAGE PROTOCOL)


DAY 3.......................................................................

TRACERT: Command to check how many roots available between two pc.
DHCP=>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
DNS=> Domain Naming System =>Its indicates the IP address of a particular website




A RECORD=> IPV4
AAAA RECORD=> IPV6
NS RECORD=> NAME SERVER

TO convert the insecure connection to secure connection
VPN => ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
 -----------------------------------VPN----------------------------------------
CLIENT<-------------------->SERVER
----------------------------------VPN-------------------------------------(LAYER OF PROTECTION)

ENCRYPTION---->CLEAR TEXT TO CIPHER TEXT
DECRYPTION---->CIPHER TEXT TO CLEAR TEXT

ENCRYPTION
1.SYMMETRIC ENCRY ---->Single key
2.ASYMMETRIC ENCRY---->Public/Private.(very secure)

WIRESHARK IS A PACKET ANALYSER TOOL
wireshark-->echo-->
ip.addr==163.70.138.35

Three way handshake=>
SYN(SYNCHRONIZATION)
SYN-ACK(SYNCHRONIZATION+ACKNOWLEDGEMENT)
ACK(ACKNOWLEDGEMENT)

TLS HANDSHAKE:(TRANSPORT LAYER SECURITY)

      
VIRUSTOOL=>
Difference between hashing and encryption:
=> Hashing is one way it can not be reversible.
PASSWORD ATTACK->BRUTE FORCE ATTACK
Combination of all.
DICTIONARY ATTACK=>

DAY 4..........................................................................

IP => NETWORK LAYER
HTTP&HTTPS=>ENCRYPTION
IN HTTPS there is a THREE WAY HANDSHAKE HAPPENS

Client Request ---->Server Response---->DATABASE
HTTP METHOD                                  RESPONSE CODE
GET                                              1xx => INFORMATIONAL
POST=>INFORMATION SEND TO THE SERVER             2XX=>OK
PUT                                              3XX=>REDIRECTION
OPTIONS                                          4XX=>Client-side ERROR
DELETE                                           5XX=>Server -side ERROR


PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT=>LIVE WEBSITES OR WEB APPLICATION
STAGING ENVIRONMENT=>ACTUAL COPY OF PROD
QA ENVIRONMENT=> TEST BUILD.
